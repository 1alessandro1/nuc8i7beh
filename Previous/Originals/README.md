# Original Clover Configurations

Here are stored the different Clover configurations that evolved over time and over old OS generations installed, leading to the one **recently** used. These are kept only for reference and comparison, as they are most likely outdated, especially with respect to some officially deprecated `<keys>` for example `SlpSmiAtWake` and `KernelCpu` etc.
